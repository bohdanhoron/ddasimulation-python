1. Reflected field: create as method in ElectricWave object, that returns new ElectricWave object as derivative.
To complete this task better understanding of Fresnel coefficients is mandatory.

2. Substrate field: I think it do not need another method, just the same interaction_matrix, but with other coordinates.
But better undestanding of polarization for different polarizations of light is needed.
